        <p>Thanks for stopping by Go Fudge Yourself, a passion project started by Neko Carrera. A former fat kid, he
            loves sweets. one night after a
            busy day at his former job at a downtown Denver pizza shop. He dreamt about the fudge his mom taught him to
            make, instead of just plain chocolate,
            he wanted something with attitude. Other than Chocolate, he loves Sour Patch Kids, this crazy concoction
            came to life in the lucid dreams that Neko has
            the taste was just right, and the smiles on the faces of his friends, lit his heart with the flame of
            creativity. the next day he followed his heart
            and bought the neccesary supplies for the fudge to be born. Watching his dream take shape, his anticipation
            was at an all time high waiting for the fudge
            to set. once it did, it was game on. He cut it up into squares, and gave one to his brother Baley Culbert.
            Who exclaimed with great joy "Oh my this is so good!"
            Neko knew he had made something special. Go Fudge Yourself was born, making fudge with attitude.
